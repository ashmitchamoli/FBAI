# A Genetic Algorithm Based Flappy Bird Bot

## How to Run
- Install Requirements
  - System should have the latest version of python installed.
  - To install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt `
- Run the file `flappybird.py`

## How it works

- Using the genetic algorithm, we train the individual instances of little birdies to navigate the maze of pillars on their own!

- The genetic algorithm mimics the process of Natural Selection. "Genes" (individual attributes (in our case, numbers) which contribute in a calculation used to take the decision (in our case, whether to jump at a particular condition or not)) make up "Chromosomes" which make up an instance in a "Population" [More Info](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-genetic-algorithms-including-example-code-e396e98d8bf3)
